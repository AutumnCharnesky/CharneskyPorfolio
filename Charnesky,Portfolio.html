        <p>You've probaby realized by now that this is a website about me and my skillfullness.
    It's all very exciting stuff. I'm sure you noticed. Oh, you're still here? that's cool.
    I didn't think this site was that interesting. Yet here you are, still reading. I would have
    given up by now. I mean, I'm just saying words and filling up space. I could do this all day.</p>
